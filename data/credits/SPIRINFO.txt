Description             : Okay, for starters:  THIS LEVEL IS LARGE.  VERY,
                          VERY, VERY LARGE.  It has ~2400 sectors and
                          ~2300 monsters on UV.  I would NOT recommend 
                          playing this level if you have a really old 
                          computer.  Second, this map is pretty hard.
                          100% kills and secrets on skill 4 is possible,
                          but difficult (I've done it with a lot
                          of saving and reloading).  Other than that, it's
                          fun with a lot of action.  So enjoy it!

Title                   : The Spire 2: Celestial, The Sky Torn Asunder

Description             : REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT NOTES YOU NEED TO READ!!!
                  - You need GOTHICTX.WAD to run this map!  Links to
                            download it are at the end of the text file.
  - This map is ENORMOUS.  If you have anything less
                            than a 1Ghz processor, don't even bother.
                          - This is probably the hardest map ever made that
                            isn't nuts.wad, with well over 3000 monsters on UV.
                            That being said, I would highly recommend HMP
                            difficulty for most players, as that is more
                            equal to normal UV difficulties.

                          Since the original "The Spire" did not, oddly
                          enough, feature spires of any sort, Celestial
                          takes place in and outside of an enormous tower.
                          The map is quite non-linear, check your automap
                          if you get lost.  Also keep in mind: ALL KEYS ARE
                          DIFFERENT!  That means blue keycard is NOT the same
                          as blue skullkey, etc.

  Feedback is appreciated!
