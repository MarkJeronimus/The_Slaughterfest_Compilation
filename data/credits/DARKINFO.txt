Every single map is more or less changed, there are also 2 new maps.
In general, many of the easier maps are harder because players can't exploit them anymore, harder maps are easier because of the increased options.
Also I am sorry for anyone have been anticipating to play the maps on older ports, as it turned out the work required to fix the map is much more tedious than I thought, and I am a very lazy person, so, no support for older ports.
However, I took the advantage of ZDOOM and created some interesting DECORATE. Don't worry, there are no new sprite or sound, I am pretty sure they are safe with 99% of the mods, and they only appear in TAT41-TAT43.
