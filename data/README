Maps for Coop servers
----------------------------------------------------
Total maps 368, for server use 250 with maybe a few more exceptions
depends on your server setup, if it's high end then you might get away
with running nearly all of them.
Also if anybody knows the actual names of some of the unnamed maps
they can be added in at a later date.....
